JDBC Database Connection Projects

This repository contains two distinct Java projects for the DBS211 course in Seneca College, one for the Final Project and the other for a Lab N6. Both projects involve using JDBC to connect to databases, execute queries, and present results. Below is an overview of each project and its functionality.

1. Final Project in Java
   Description
The Final Project is focused on demonstrating a full-scale Java application that connects to an Oracle database using JDBC. This project involves executing SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and display data from a relational database. It allows for deeper understanding and hands-on experience with database interactions.

2.  Lab N6: JDBC Queries
  Description
The Lab N6 project is a smaller-scale application focused on executing simple SQL queries to fetch data from the database using JDBC. This project is designed as part of the DBS211 course to help students understand the basics of database interaction through JDBC.
